# This a partially completed program. I would like the user to start from a screen that allows them to search for a customer in the customer table. If a customer is found in the table, then user should be taken to screen that has that customer's information as well as any jobs or quotes associated with that customer. They should be able to add newjobs and new quotes and edit existing jobs and quotes associated with that customer from this screen. Each quote should be made up of one or more tasks and each task should be made up of one or more step, and there should be place to estimate time and material cost for each step. Each job should be linked to a quote for ease of reference. If no customer is found on initial search, user should be taken to a screen where they can add a new customer and it should include, pre-populated, the information the user used to search the customer table with. Adding a new customer should take the user to a new quote screen, where a new quote can be generated, associated with the customer just created.
